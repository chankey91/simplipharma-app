⚠️ IMPORTANT: Firebase Auth Client SDK Limitation ⚠️

When you create a new user from the Admin User Management screen, 
you will be AUTOMATICALLY LOGGED OUT.

This is a Firebase security limitation when using the CLIENT SDK.

WHAT TO DO:
1. Create the user account
2. You'll be logged out automatically
3. Login again using your admin credentials
4. Continue managing users

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
Firebase's createUserWithEmailAndPassword() automatically logs in 
the newly created user for security reasons. The app tries to log 
them out immediately, but you'll still need to re-authenticate.

PRODUCTION SOLUTION:
For production apps, use Firebase Admin SDK on a backend server 
to create users without this limitation. See ADMIN_USER_MANAGEMENT.md 
for details.

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
✅ App already handles this as gracefully as possible
✅ You just need to log back in after creating each user
